## My B.Tech Journey So Far ðŸš€

Hello readers! I'm **Shubham Prasad**, a passionate Computer Science and Engineering student from **Dumka Engineering College (Session 2024â€“28)**.

### ðŸ“Œ Why I Chose CSE

From a young age, Iâ€™ve always been curious about how apps, websites, and technology work behind the scenes. That curiosity led me to explore programming, and soon I knew that **CSE was the right path** for me.

### ðŸŽ¯ Expectations vs Reality

I expected college life to be full of tech learning and practical codingâ€”but the reality was more diverse:
- I faced core subjects like **Engineering Physics**, **Biology for Engineers**, and **Mechanics** in the first semester.
- While it was challenging, it made me more adaptable and disciplined.

### ðŸ’» What Iâ€™ve Learned So Far

- **GitHub & VS Code:** Learning version control and how to push code is a game changer.
- **HTML/CSS/JS:** Iâ€™ve built my own portfolio site (which youâ€™re seeing right now).
- **Teamwork & Discipline:** Managing projects, labs, and deadlines sharpened my mindset.

### ðŸš§ Challenges Faced

- Understanding GitHub for the first time was confusing ðŸ˜…
- Internet issues during online resources and submissions
- Staying consistent with self-study

But Iâ€™ve realized one thing: **"No goal is bigger than a person's struggle! The one who has lost is the one who did not fight!"**

### ðŸ’¡ What's Next?

This is just the beginning! I plan to:
- Explore backend development
- Create more real-world projects
- Share weekly blogs to help others in their journey

Thanks for reading! ðŸ’™
